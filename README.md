# space-engineers-scripts
Some ingame scripts for programmable block

The simplest code reuse is implemented using the #include "directive" in the code comments. Several files are simply combined into one with the removal of comments and blank lines and the contents of the resulting file are copied to the clipboard.

Currently linux-only preparing.

Ready-to-use scripts are in the "prepared" directory, you only need to specify the names of groups / blocks
